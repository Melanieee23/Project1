        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>I found that being aware of the history of Barcelona was very important in understanding the culutre.</p>
     <p>   Barcelona is in Catalonia (Catalunya in Catalan) which is an autonomous community in northeastern Spain. The sentiment of Catalan identity and a desire for independence from Spain have deep historical roots. </p>
      <h3>Language </h3>
      <p>Catalan, the official language of Catalonia. Catalan is a Romance language evolving from Latin,  just like Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. Most people however also speak Spanish as most people are typically bilingual with Spanish. Many Catalans are fluent in both Catalan and Spanish, using them interchangeably in different contexts.Catalans take pride in their language, literature, and art which foster a sense of distinct identity. I noticed a common letter in Catalan was "x" so stores with words such as "Xurreria Trebol" which is a churro shop in the city. I noticed the super markets were "Mercat" which is another Catalan word. </p>
            <h3>Traditions </h3>
            <p> Catalonia, with its rich cultural heritage, has a variety of traditions which are useful to be knowledagble on before you visit.  </p>
            <p> Diada de Sant Jordi: Every year on April 23rd, Catalonia celebrates the Diada de Sant Jordi. People exchange roses and books and everyone is out in the streets. I have a picture from this day when I was in the city center</p>
